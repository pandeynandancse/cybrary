Learning objectives:
why CLI is important   ---- actions at cli can be easily replicated.-->>>many advance tools that does not have to gui  --->>> automate boring tasks.
difference between cli and gui ---->>> gui is easy to understand.
open command line in windows  --->> start and type cmd  -->>window key + R and then type cmd -->> right click on windows icon and click windows powershell.
open terminal on linux




<command><switch><parameter>

Linux manual pages can be accessed by -->> man
manual page for grep   ---->>>   man grep
to get help in terminal or cmd ---->> help
in windows know more about command -->> grep /help   or grep /?
in terinal know more about command -->> grep -h   or  grep--help




pwd
dir -> windows //////  ls -->> linus
cd




Customize cli environment --
windows   -   properites in top left corner 
linux     -    edit and preferences and go to color for changing color
fg--> .restarts a paused commands




Directories and drive--
mkdir - make new directory
cd -- change direcory
cd /d[drive] -- windows only ==>>         cd /d D:\         ===>> gone to D drive
Tree ---- Graphically dispalys folder and file structures   -->> sudo apt-get install tree   --->>> tree ~/Downlaods     ----->>> show all files






----------------------------------

                                            hashing vs encoding
