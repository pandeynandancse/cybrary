Learning objectives:
why CLI is important   ---- actions at cli can be easily replicated.-->>>many advance tools that does not have to gui  --->>> automate boring tasks.
difference between cli and gui ---->>> gui is easy to understand.
open command line in windows  --->> start and type cmd  -->>window key + R and then type cmd -->> right click on windows icon and click windows powershell.
open terminal on linux




<command><switch><parameter>

Linux manual pages can be accessed by -->> man
manual page for grep   ---->>>   man grep
to get help in terminal or cmd ---->> help
in windows know more about command -->> grep /help   or grep /?
in terinal know more about command -->> grep -h   or  grep--help




pwd
dir -> windows //////  ls -->> linus
cd




Customize cli environment --
windows   -   properites in top left corner 
linux     -    edit and preferences and go to color for changing color
fg--> .restarts a paused commands




Directories and drive--
mkdir - make new directory
cd -- change direcory
cd /d[drive] -- windows only ==>>         cd /d D:\         ===>> gone to D drive
Tree ---- Graphically dispalys folder and file structures   -->> sudo apt-get install tree   --->>> tree ~/Downlaods     ----->>> show all files






----------------------------------
for linux-->>>
grep  search_content file_name                                  -->>> search through text 
ngrep                                  --> network grep --> searching through network packet capture file
cat                                     -- read a file   -- concatenate files also
more                                    -   also reads file
less                                    -- also reads file -- important in comparison with more
cp file_name dedstination_folder              -- copy
cp -R                                    --- copy recursively
mv  file_name dedstination_folder         ----- move    --- also used to rename files
rm                                          ----   remove files  
rm -r                                      ---- recurssively remove files
rm -f                                       --- f is force without prompting


-------------------------------------------
for windows-->>
type                                   --- displays content of file
more                                    -- displays a file one screen a a time

del /s                     ---- /s is used for deleting subdirectories
erase                        ---- same as del

findstr






--------------------------------

                                            hashing vs encoding
hashing -- one way algo  -->> can not be revrsed  --> useed to validate integrity  ---->>> example= md5sum , sha1sum
encoding --->> reversible   ---->>> example = base64

echo "hello" | base64     ---->> convert 'hello' into base64
echo "base64 string goes here" | base64 -d        ----->>>>> decode base64 goes here into readable format
